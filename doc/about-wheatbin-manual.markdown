About Wheatbin manual
============

Wheatbin software is a fork of Kanboard, and for this reason the Kanboard documentation has been left untouched, including screenshots. 

However, Wheatbin's UI has been significantly streamlined and improved. The images you see may not look identical to how Wheatbin has been redesigned.
