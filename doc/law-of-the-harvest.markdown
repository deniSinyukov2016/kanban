What is the Law of the Harvest?
===============

The <strong>Law of the Harvest</strong> is the philosophy behind Wheatbin. It is a universal precept taught 2000 years ago in the Lotus Sutra (a core Buddhist philosophy) and in the Bible, Galatians 6:7-10. This Law is divided into seven smaller laws. All are patterned after nature and apply to practically everything we do:

- <strong>We reap what we sow.</strong> If you plant sunflower seeds, in a season’s time your garden will be bright with yellow sunflowers. But don’t expect turnips. Likewise, what you focus on is what you become.

- <strong>We reap in a different season than  we sow.</strong> Seedtime to harvest takes patience and persistence, two things in short supply in this age of instant gratification.

- <strong>We reap more than we sow.</strong> Every seed grown has a multiplier effect. An apple seed grows into a tree with branches heavy-laden with apples.

- <strong>We reap  in  proportion to what  we sow.</strong> If we sow sparingly, we reap sparingly. The more seeds we plant, and the farther afield we scatter the seeds, the greater the harvest.

- <strong>We reap  what others  have sown and  cultivated.</strong> The books we read, the art that inspires us, even the clean water we drink  have all been made possible by the vision, ingenuity and labour of others. On the other hand, others will reap some of the harvest from your seeds. This is a good thing... it’s your legacy.

- <strong>Weeds grow effortlessly and on their  own,</strong> but to reap a good harvest often requires vision, persistence and hard work. You’ll  be most successful if you work towards visions that inspire you to keep going, even as weeds of distraction choke your resolve.

- <strong>We can’t change  last year’s harvest,</strong> but we can look forward with hope to this season’s crops. Don’t focus on past failures. Identify and focus on those things you can control and that are key factors to being successful.

The Law of the Harvest is embedded in the fabric of life. By consciously applying these laws of nature (Wheatbin can help) you can improve the harvest from the seeds you sow.
