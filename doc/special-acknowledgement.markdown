Special Acknowledgement
============

Wheatbin software is a fork of Kanboard and would not be a reality if it wasn't for the technical skills, leadership and generosity of Frédéric Guillot, the developer and founder of Kanboard. 

As the redesigner and developer of Wheatbin, I thank Frédéric for his major contribution to Open Source.

To everyone reading this, I hope you enjoy using Wheatbin.


Sincerely,
